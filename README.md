# KNN_Classification_Model

🔍 Hands-on Machine Learning Project | KNN Classification

Recently, I worked on a Machine Learning classification project using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with the Social Network Ads dataset.

📌 Project Objective
To analyze user behavior and predict product purchase decisions based on Age and Estimated Salary.

⚙️ What I Worked On
▪ Data cleaning and preprocessing
▪ Feature scaling to improve distance-based learning
▪ Splitting data into training and testing sets
▪ Building a KNN classification model
▪ Evaluating model performance using accuracy score and confusion matrix

📈 Key Takeaway
This project highlighted the importance of feature scaling in distance-based algorithms like KNN and strengthened my understanding of supervised learning and model evaluation.
